# [WIP] Unreal Source Explained

[toc]

## Thread Overview
Unreal has these several important threads:
- Game thread
- Main (App) thread
- Task Threads
	- Rendering thread(s)
	- File I/O thread

This following image is the *threads overview* in the profiler. Threads are sorted by their CPU Time, which usually infer their importance.

### Game Thread
**`[IOSAppDelegate MainAppThread:]`** in the thread overview image.

Game thread's main mission is running `FEngineLoop`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/33e9eedc27e80b9e67c1d1a2667672ed23c7531b/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Public/LaunchEngineLoop.h#L21)), including its initialization `PreInit()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42cbf957ad0e713dec57a5828f72d116c8083011/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Private/LaunchEngineLoop.cpp#L1158)) and tick `Tick()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42cbf957ad0e713dec57a5828f72d116c8083011/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Private/LaunchEngineLoop.cpp#L4012)).  
Every game is running frame by frame. Inside one frame, several submodules are called sequentially. This routine is known as *Game Loop*.  
`FEngineLoop` is Unreal's game loop. Each time `FEngineLoop::Tick()` is called, that means one new frame has just begun.

Note that in Unreal, game thread's name is `[IOSAppDelegate MainAppThread:]`, it means its Unreal's main thread, do not confuse with the process's main thread.

### Main (App) Thread
**`Main Thread`** in the thread overview image.

This thread is the this iOS process's main thread, it's the first thread that gets created.  
In Unreal, Main thread doesn't carry out heavy jobs, it just handles some native iOS messages, such as touch event.

### Task Threads


## Loop


## Initialization
Unreal app is initialized via `FEngineLoop::PreInit()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/42cbf957ad0e713dec57a5828f72d116c8083011/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Private/LaunchEngineLoop.cpp#L993)), no matter what platform, e.g., iOS is initialized in `FAppEntry::Init()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/395c9713d5b5eee9daf8b7077bcac311c85a63a1/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Private/IOS/LaunchIOS.cpp#L372)), Android is in `AndroidMain()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/8951e6117b483a89befe98ac2102caad2ce26cab/Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Private/Android/LaunchAndroid.cpp#L445)).

### Class reflection data
Most (near all) `Z_Construct_UClass_XXX()` fuctions are called only in the initialization stage via `ProcessNewlyLoadedUObjects()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/b4a54829162aa07a28846da2e91147912a7b67d8/Engine/Source/Runtime/CoreUObject/Private/UObject/UObjectBase.cpp#L983)).
![](img/Class_reflection_data_allocation.png)

`Z_Construct_UClass_XXX()` are functions that construct the Unreal intrinsic "class reflection data". These functions' code are generated by macro in `IMPLEMENT_INTRINSIC_CLASS`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/0f9ad9685896e0581d0fe963034b1cb82b1a4e3b/Engine/Source/Runtime/CoreUObject/Public/UObject/ObjectMacros.h#L1604)):

```C++
// Used for intrinsics, this sets up the boiler plate, plus an initialization singleton, which can create properties and GC tokens
#define IMPLEMENT_INTRINSIC_CLASS(TClass, TRequiredAPI, TSuperClass, TSuperRequiredAPI, TPackage, InitCode) \
	IMPLEMENT_CLASS(TClass, 0) \
	TRequiredAPI UClass* Z_Construct_UClass_##TClass(); \
	struct Z_Construct_UClass_##TClass##_Statics \
	{ \
		static UClass* Construct() \
		{ \
			extern TSuperRequiredAPI UClass* Z_Construct_UClass_##TSuperClass(); \
			UClass* SuperClass = Z_Construct_UClass_##TSuperClass(); \
			UClass* Class = TClass::StaticClass(); \
			UObjectForceRegistration(Class); \
			check(Class->GetSuperClass() == SuperClass); \
			InitCode \
			Class->StaticLink(); \
			return Class; \
		} \
	}; \
	UClass* Z_Construct_UClass_##TClass() \
	{ \
		static UClass* Class = NULL; \
		if (!Class) \
		{ \
			Class = Z_Construct_UClass_##TClass##_Statics::Construct();\
		} \
		check(Class->GetClass()); \
		return Class; \
	} \

    ...
```

## Memory Management

### Heap allocation
Most heap memory is allocated via `FMallocBinned::Malloc()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/517200ac3453d54b233c228a24e5060bc0439065/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/HAL/MallocBinned.cpp#L916)).
![](img/Heap_allocation.png)

`FMallocBinned` is commentted as *"Optimized virtual memory allocator"*, it's actually implemented as [*Memory Pool*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_pool), where objects with specific size (8B, 16B, ..., 32KB)([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/517200ac3453d54b233c228a24e5060bc0439065/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/HAL/MallocBinned.cpp#L866)) is allocated from corresponding pool([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/517200ac3453d54b233c228a24e5060bc0439065/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/HAL/MallocBinned.cpp#L969)).  
Allocation is thread-safe and locked for the specific pool.([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/517200ac3453d54b233c228a24e5060bc0439065/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Private/HAL/MallocBinned.cpp#L974))

### Global operator new
Only Windows has global `operator new()`([link](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/8951e6117b483a89befe98ac2102caad2ce26cab/Engine/Source/Runtime/Core/Public/MemPro/MemPro.h#L688)), which means, unlike Unity, your code's new operator is not managed by the engine, and is just handled by the operating system.
```C++
#ifdef OVERRIDE_NEW_DELETE

	#if defined(_WIN32) || defined(_WIN64) || defined(WIN32) || defined(WIN64) || defined(__WIN32__) || defined(__WINDOWS__)
		#include <malloc.h>

		void* operator new(size_t size)
		{
			void* p = malloc(size);
			MEMPRO_TRACK_ALLOC(p, size);
			return p;
		}

		void operator delete(void* p)
		{
			MEMPRO_TRACK_FREE(p);
			free(p);
		}
        ...
	#endif
#endif
```
